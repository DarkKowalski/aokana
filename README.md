# Aokana

## What's this?

Extract my lovely waifus' voice data from a certain galgame franchises.

This only works for copies purchased on Steam which are developed with Unity and Mono.

## How?

```shell
# For the original version and Extra1
./aokana.exe -i voice.dat -o extracted

# For Extra2
./aokana.exe -i voice.dat -o extracted --extra2
```
